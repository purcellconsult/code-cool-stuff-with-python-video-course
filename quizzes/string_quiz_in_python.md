    If you can make one heap of all your winnings  
     And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
     And never breathe a word about your loss;If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  
     To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you  
     Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!
     '"""
