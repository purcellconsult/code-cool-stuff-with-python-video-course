## Python Quizzes

These quizzes are recommended to do with the *Code Cool Stuff with Python* video course but youâ€™re more to solve these problems in isolation.  These questions are recommended for beginner python developers trying to get into the intermediate level. These questions are also an excellent choice for undergraduate computer science programs.  Topics tested throughout these quizzes are:

- Control flow in python
- Iteration in python: Both for and while loops
- The four built-in data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Creating your own functions in python
- String processing in python
- Object oriented programming in python
- The turtle module 
- The Tkinter module for building GUIs
