## Script Hint  
  
__init__: The constructor will initialize the instance variables and do the initial setup for the program. In here a TK instance will be created and the title, size, and the background color set. The instance variables that will be used throughout the program are created here.  
  
**fahrenheit_to_celsius**: This is the method that will calculate the conversion of Fahrenheit to Celsius.  
  
**celsius_to_fahrenheit**: This is the method that will convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
  
**create_widget**s: In this method weâ€™ll create and configure the various widgets that will be used throughout such as the `Label`, `Button`, and `Entry` widgets.  
  
**if __name__ == '__main__**': This is the entry point of the program. An instance of the class will be created and then the various methods will be invoked all followed by a call to mainloop.  
  
Now that the script is broken down into methods, fill in the rest.
