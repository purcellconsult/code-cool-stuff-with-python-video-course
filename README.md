data analysis, scientific computing, and web scraping/ data collection. Students will accomplish the following in this course: 

- How to get python setup on their computer
- How to develop python scripts with the PyCharm IDE
- The various data types in python
- How to control the order in which statements execute in python
- How to iterate using the for and while loops
- How to import modules 
- How to use try/except statements
- How to process and manipulate strings
- How to create your own functions
- How to do object oriented programming in python 
- How to computer graphics in python
- How to build simple Desktop apps 
- How to create a text based calculator 
- How to build a random person generator
